			<p>Worrigee Medical Centre opening back in 2008 from 1 Doctor to having 13 Doctors working part time or full time now in 2019.</p><br />
          <p>Our goal is to provide a quality, caring service affordable medical service to the community.</p>
          <p>We have a collaborative health care team made up of general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses (PNs) including,mental health nurses, Pschycologist, a credentialed diabetes educator, podiatrists an external pathology service provider, dietitians a practice administration team.</p><br />	
          <p>Our Proactive health practitioners identify preventative and chronic disease care concerns, address risky lifestyle behaviours, domestic violence, suicide risk, identify falls risk and refer clients for follow-up services within the practice and the community.</p><br />
          <p>Worrigee Medical Centre runs an appointment system; however we do keep openings for emergencies. You can make an appointment with your doctor by phoning the surgery or online via the app or at sfmc.net.au. Urgent medical problems will be dealt with promptly. Appointments are made at 10 – 20 minute intervals. When making your appointment please advise staff if you have forms to fill in or you need extra time.</p><br />
          <p>Nobody likes to be kept waiting and we are all aware of this and try to adhere to appointment schedules. However, the unpredictable nature of medical practice means that doctors sometimes run behind time. This is mostly due to a patient requiring urgent medical attention. We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused to patients when we fall behind with our appointment schedule.</p><br />
          <p>We also have a Pharmacy onsite for all your prescription needs and other miscellaneous items.</p><br />
